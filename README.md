This project is intended for learning purposes.

## Introduction

Here I create a React messenger application based on the JavaScript Mastery tutorial.
The project uses Firebase and Chatengine tools 

### Bonus - E-mail notifications

If you want to upgrade this chat application even further than what is shown in the video, you can add e-mail notifications. More info on https://chatengine.io/docs/email_notifications.
